This project attempts to build a classification predictive model to  classify  whether  the  closing  value  of  the  stock  market  will  go  up  or  down depending  on  the  25  top  news  articles/headings  current  to  that  day.  I  realised  straight  away  that  this  might not  lead  to  a  model  that  will  be  predicting  the  market  movement  with  any  significant  success  whatsoever,  or even  higher  than  the  simple  throw  of  a  dice.  A  lot  of  inspiration  has  also  come  from  an  example  of  the  stockmarket  modelling  in  “An  Introduction  to  Statistical  Learning”  by  G.  James. But  the  curiosity  was  overwhelming  and  I  wanted  to  give  it  my  best  shot  to  see  how  far  I  can  take  it. It  gave  me  a  platform  to  experiment,  research  and learn.  As  Andrew  NG  mentions  in  his  newbook  “Machine  Learning  Yearning”  (only  a  draft  verision,  released  in  batches),  when  faced  with  challenging tasks,  it  is  best  to  start  with  a  simple  concept  and  build  on  that. I  enjoyed  it,  despite  being  unable  to  deliver  a  model  that  I  silently  hoped  I  would,  but  neverthless,  I  learned a  great  deal,  and  have  new ideas  on  how  to  take  it  futher.  The  dataset  is  available  from https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews/data2
